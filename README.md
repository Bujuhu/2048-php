This is a version of 2048 extended with public scoreboards via php. Please note, that this (like most of my project) shouldn't be taken too seriously, as this is for a good mark, not for practical use.

Most of the additions will be poorly implemented as I want to spend my time on this as little as possible. Also, these additons won't be really be usefull but are required by my school to fullfill this project.
