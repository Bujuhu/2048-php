This is a version of 2048 extended with public scoreboards via php and mysql. Please note, that this (like most of my projects) shouldn't be taken too seriously, as this is for a good mark, not for practical use.

Most of the additions will be poorly implemented as I want to spend my time on this as little as possible.
